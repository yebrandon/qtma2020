## About

Voluntera is a marketplace for volunteering opportunities. People looking for ways to make an impact on their community can connect with organizations and businesses that need their help, and have their hours, contributions, and opportunities all consolidated into a single web app.

This project is currently being developed by the Voluntera team at QTMA, Queen's Tech and Media Association.
